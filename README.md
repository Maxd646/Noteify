# 📝 Noteify

Noteify is a **simple, responsive, and interactive note-taking web application** inspired by Evernote.  
It helps users **create, edit, delete, and search notes** effortlessly — designed in two learning phases:  
**Phase 1 (HTML + CSS)** and **Phase 2 (JavaScript Interactivity)**.

---

## 📘 Project Synopsis

Noteify is built as a **learning and productivity web app**, combining modern frontend principles with minimalism.  
It aims to demonstrate how to progress from **static design (HTML/CSS)** to **dynamic interactivity (JavaScript)**.

Users can:

- Take notes quickly.
- Manage them locally using `localStorage`.
- Search, edit, and delete notes in real-time.

This project showcases foundational web development skills — perfect for both **learners and portfolio projects**.
