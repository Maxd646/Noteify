# Noteify

Noteify is a **simple, responsive, and interactive note-taking web application** .  
It helps users **create, edit, delete, and search notes** effortlessly — designed in two learning phases:  
**Phase 1 (HTML + CSS)** and **Phase 2 (JavaScript Interactivity)**.

---

## Project Synopsis

Noteify is built as a **learning and productivity web app**, combining modern frontend principles with minimalism.  
It aims to demonstrate how to progress from **static design (HTML/CSS)** to **dynamic interactivity (JavaScript)**.

Users can:

- Take notes quickly.
- Manage them locally using `localStorage`.
- Search, edit, and delete notes in real-time.

This project showcases foundational web development skills — perfect for both **learners and portfolio projects**.

## Implemented Solution

The solution focuses on building a lightweight, offline-friendly web app that works in the browser without any backend.  
Key implementation details include:

- **LocalStorage-based persistence** (no need for a database).
- **Responsive layout** with Flexbox and Grid.
- **Dynamic DOM manipulation** for CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations.
- **Dark mode toggle** for better accessibility.
- **Clean UI/UX** following modern minimal design standards.
